End User License Agreement - Version 2.0
Last Updated: February 2026

1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS

By installing, copying, or otherwise using this software ("Software"), you agree to be bound by the terms of this End User License Agreement ("Agreement"). If you do not agree to these terms, do not install or use the Software.

2. LICENSE GRANT

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, you are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to install and use the Software on devices you own or control, solely for your personal, non-commercial use in managing your coin collection.

3. LICENSE TIERS

The Software is offered in two tiers:

(a) Free Version. The Free Version provides core functionality at no cost, including single-coin data enrichment from the Numista catalog. The Free Version may display periodic prompts encouraging upgrade to the Supporter Edition.

(b) Supporter Edition. The Supporter Edition is available through purchase of a license key and provides additional features including batch pricing updates (Fast Pricing Mode), batch type data propagation (Auto-Propagate), and removal of upgrade prompts. A Supporter license key:

- May be activated on up to five (5) devices you own or control
- Is non-transferable and may not be shared, sold, or given to others
- Covers the current major version of the Software and all updates within that major version (e.g., version 1.x includes all 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 releases)
- Does not automatically include future major versions (e.g., version 2.0); new major versions with significant added functionality may require a separate purchase
- Entitles you to discounted pricing on future major version upgrades as a benefit of being an existing supporter
- Grants access to premium features as they exist at time of purchase; future premium features may require additional purchase
- Does not grant ownership of the Software, access to source code, or any intellectual property rights
- May be deactivated from a device to free an activation slot for use on a different device
- Is subject to validation through third-party license management services (currently Polar.sh)

Both license tiers are subject to all other terms of this Agreement. The Developer reserves the right to modify features available in each tier.

4. RESTRICTIONS

- Circumvent, disable, or interfere with license validation or activation systems
- Use the Software for any commercial purpose
- Remove or alter any proprietary notices, labels, or marks on the Software

5. THIRD-PARTY SERVICES

This Software uses the Numista API to retrieve numismatic data and Polar.sh for license management. By using this Software:

- You acknowledge that you have your own separate agreement with Numista, obtained when you registered for an API key
- You understand that your use of Numista's services is governed solely by your agreement with them

- The Developer is not responsible for your interactions, dealings, or disputes with Numista or Polar.sh
- The Developer does not control and is not liable for any data provided by these third parties

6. DATA COLLECTION AND PRIVACY

The Software is designed with privacy in mind:

- Local Data Only. Your coin collection data remains stored locally on your device in your OpenNumismat database. The Software does not upload, transmit, or store your collection data on any external servers.
- No Personal Information Collected. The Software does not collect, store, or transmit personal information such as your name, email address, location, or browsing history.
- API Communications. The Software makes requests to the Numista API to retrieve catalog data and to Polar.sh for license validation. These requests contain only the minimum information necessary for operation (such as coin identifiers for Numista lookups and license keys for validation).
- Device Fingerprint. For Supporter Edition license activation, a device fingerprint (derived from hardware identifiers) is generated and transmitted to Polar.sh solely to manage device activation limits. This fingerprint is not linked to your personal identity.
- Local Settings. Application preferences (such as your Numista API key and license activation status) are stored locally on your device and are not transmitted to the Developer.

7. CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS (CCPA/CPRA)

If you are a California resident, you have specific rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA):

- Right to Know. You have the right to know what personal information is collected. As stated above, this Software does not collect personal information.
- Right to Delete. You have the right to request deletion of personal information. Since no personal information is collected or stored by the Developer, there is nothing to delete. Your local application settings can be removed by uninstalling the Software.
- Right to Opt-Out of Sale. The Developer does not sell, share, or disclose personal information to third parties for monetary or other valuable consideration.
- Right to Non-Discrimination. You will not receive discriminatory treatment for exercising your privacy rights.
- Sensitive Personal Information. The Software does not collect sensitive personal information as defined under California law.

This Agreement does not grant you any rights to trademarks or service marks of the Developer. Purchase of a Supporter Edition license grants only the right to use premium features; it does not constitute purchase of the Software itself or any intellectual property rights therein.
