1. ALWAYS consult the MASTER-PROJECT-DOCUMENT before doing any work as this contains the structure, past errors and continued rules for the project. You are to always update this document after any changes to ensure that it is an up to date repository for all knowledge on the project. 
2. Never give me snippets of code. You are to develop pull requests in github to modify all project files. 
3. ALL FILES ARE IN GITHUB!
4. final-field-mapping.md in github contains all of the mapping between Numista and OpenNumismat fields. You are to keep this document updated. 
5. swagger.yaml in github contains the documentation for the Numista API. 
6. No cussing, that is for humans only. 
7. code files are in github /src and related sub-directories. 
8. Always follow EMOJI-ENCODING-GUIDANCE.md when dealing with emojis and NEVER use any utilities or applications that will result in corruption of encoding. This is a consistent problem. 
9. If something is not working correctly... STOP! Do not waste my tokens. I need to know right away.
