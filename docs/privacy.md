# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** February 10, 2026
**Last Updated:** February 10, 2026

## Overview

NumiSync Wizard is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains what data is collected, how it is used, and your rights regarding your information.

## Data Collection

**NumiSync Wizard does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on our servers.**

### What We Don't Collect

- **No Usage Analytics:** We do not track how you use the application
- **No Telemetry:** We do not collect technical data or performance metrics
- **No Crash Reports:** Crash data is not automatically sent to us
- **No Personal Information:** We do not collect names, email addresses, or any identifying information
- **No Coin Collection Data:** Your coin collection data stays on your local machine

## How NumiSync Wizard Works

### Local Processing

- All coin matching and data enrichment happens **locally on your computer**
- Your OpenNumismat database (`.db` file) is accessed locally and never uploaded anywhere
- Cache data is stored locally in the application data folder

### Third-Party API Usage

**Numista API:**
- You provide your own Numista API key in the application settings
- API requests are made **directly from your computer to Numista** (not through our servers)
- Your API key is stored locally and never transmitted to us
- Numista's privacy policy applies to data you share with their service: [numista.com](https://www.numista.com/)

### License Purchases

**Supporter License (via Polar.sh):**
- License purchases are processed through [Polar.sh](https://polar.sh/)
- Polar.sh collects payment information and email for license delivery
- We receive only the license key and activation details (no payment information)
- Polar.sh's privacy policy applies: [polar.sh/legal/privacy](https://polar.sh/legal/privacy)

---

## Data Storage

### Local Storage Only

All application data is stored locally on your computer:

- **Settings:** Application preferences, API key, field mappings
- **Cache:** Numista API responses (to reduce redundant requests)
- **License:** Supporter license key (if purchased)
- **Logs:** Application logs for debugging (stored locally, not transmitted)

**You have full control** over this data and can delete it at any time by uninstalling the application or clearing the application data folder.

**Important:** We do not control these third-party services. Please review their privacy policies for information on how they handle your data.
