# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** February 10, 2026
**Last Updated:** February 25, 2026

## Overview

NumiSync Wizard is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains what data is collected, how it is used, and your rights regarding your information.

---

## Data Collection

**The NumiSync Wizard desktop application does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on our servers.** The numisync.com website uses Google Analytics 4 for anonymous traffic measurement — details below.

### What the Desktop Application Does Not Collect

- **No Usage Analytics:** We do not track how you use the application
- **No Telemetry:** We do not collect technical data or performance metrics
- **No Crash Reports:** Crash data is not automatically sent to us
- **No Personal Information:** We do not collect names, email addresses, or any identifying information
- **No Coin Collection Data:** Your coin collection data stays on your local machine

### Website Analytics (numisync.com only)

The numisync.com website uses **Google Analytics 4** to measure anonymous traffic. This does **not** apply to the desktop application.

Data collected by Google Analytics on this website:
- Page views and navigation paths
- Session duration and bounce rate
- Country and region (derived from IP address, not stored)
- Device type, operating system, and browser
- Click events on download buttons (platform chosen) and the license purchase button

This data is aggregated and anonymous — we cannot identify individual visitors. Google processes this data per their [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy). You can opt out using the [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

## How NumiSync Wizard Works

### Local Processing

- All coin matching and data enrichment happens **locally on your computer**
- Your OpenNumismat database (`.db` file) is accessed locally and never uploaded anywhere
- Cache data is stored locally in the application data folder

### Third-Party API Usage

**Numista API:**
- You provide your own Numista API key in the application settings
- API requests are made **directly from your computer to Numista** (not through our servers)
- Your API key is stored locally and never transmitted to us
- Numista's privacy policy applies to data you share with their service: [numista.com](https://www.numista.com/)

### License Purchases

**Supporter License (via Polar.sh):**
- License purchases are processed through [Polar.sh](https://polar.sh/)
- Polar.sh collects payment information and email for license delivery
- We receive only the license key and activation details (no payment information)
- Polar.sh's privacy policy applies: [polar.sh/legal/privacy](https://polar.sh/legal/privacy)

---

## Data Storage

### Local Storage Only

All application data is stored locally on your computer:

- **Settings:** Application preferences, API key, field mappings
- **Cache:** Numista API responses (to reduce redundant requests)
- **License:** Supporter license key (if purchased)
- **Logs:** Application logs for debugging (stored locally, not transmitted)

**You have full control** over this data and can delete it at any time by uninstalling the application or clearing the application data folder.

| **Google Analytics 4** | Website traffic measurement (numisync.com only) | Anonymous page views, device type, country, click events | [policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) |

**Important:** We do not control these third-party services. Please review their privacy policies for information on how they handle your data.

## Your Rights

Since we do not collect or store your data on our servers, there is no data for us to access, modify, or delete. You have complete control over all data stored locally by the application.

### Managing Your Data
