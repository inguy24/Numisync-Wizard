## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I use my license on multiple computers?

Yes! You can activate your license on up to **5 devices**. Perfect for home, work, laptop, and backup machines.

### Is this a subscription?

No! **Buy once, use forever.** Your license never expires and includes all features from version 1.x.

### What about future major versions (v2.0, v3.0)?

Your v1 license unlocks all v1.x features permanently. Future major versions (v2.0+) with significant new features may require a separate license, but existing v1 features will continue working. Early supporters will receive upgrade discounts.

### I lost my license key. Can I retrieve it?

Yes! Your license key is tied to your email address. Check your purchase confirmation email from Polar.sh, or contact support with your purchase email.

### Does this support the developer?

Absolutely! Your $10 helps cover:
- Domain hosting and SSL certificates
- API infrastructure and caching servers
- Development time for new features
- Code signing certificates (when available)
- Coffee for late-night debugging sessions ☕

Every supporter license directly funds NumiSync's continued development and keeps it free for basic use.
