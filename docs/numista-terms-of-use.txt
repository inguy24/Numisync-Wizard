Thus, the User must read these Terms of Use carefully when accessing the

These ToU are available at the bottom of each page of the Platform /via/
a hypertext link and can thus be read at any time.

By using the Platform, the User acknowledges that they have the
necessary means and skills to use the features offered on the Platform.

The equipment required to access and use the Platform is at the User's

    SECTION 5. ROLE OF THE OPERATOR


      Section 5.1. Content of NUMISTA’s intervention

NUMISTA can play two distinct roles on the Platform:


        Section 5.1.1. Intervention as a simple intermediary

The Platform published by NUMISTA proposes a matchmaking service, by
electronic means, to the Collectors allowing them in particular to
exchange Collector's Items.

NUMISTA has no control over the execution of the exchange of
Collectibles and does not intervene in the relationship between the
Collectors.

The Registrations of Collectibles are established by the Collectors.

NUMISTA is paid by advertising and through a Premium Subscription
offered to Users, whose subscription is governed by the Terms and
Conditions of Subscription.

When you click on links to various merchants on the Platform and make a
purchase, this can result in NUMISTA earning a commission. Affiliate
programs and affiliations include, but are not limited to, the eBay
Partner Network.


        Section 5.1.2. Intervention as a service provider

NUMISTA also proposes directly on the Platform other Services for
Collectors.


      Section 5.2. General pre-contractual information obligation:
      fairness, clarity and transparency


        Section 5.2.1. General provisions

As an online platform operator, NUMISTA acts in a neutral, clear and
transparent way.

NUMISTA does not have any capital link or any legal dependence with one
of the Collectors referenced on the Platform which would influence the
classification or the referencing of the Collectibles.

The Collectibles and, more precisely, the Catalogue Pages are presented
to internet users on the Platform according to the User's choice:

The default sorting is as follows: by country of issue (alphabetical
order), by quotation (chronological order), by face value, by date, by
commemorated event and by title.

On each Catalogue Page, an extract of the list of Collectors offering
this type of Collectible Object is presented in random order. It is
possible to access the details by year of issue. For each year of issue,
the Collectors are displayed in random order.

On the page that displays all Active Collectors who offer Collectibles
for trade:

The default sorting is random, but it is possible to sort by
alphabetical order of the User's name, by rating following the
evaluations of the Swaps, by country, by number of Collectibles offered
by the Collectors and which could be of interest to the User (according
to the defined wishes), the number of Collectibles offered for Swap by
the User and which could interest the Collector (according to the
defined wishes), by date of registration on the Platform, and by
distance (according to the location provided by the Collector and that
of the User).

It is specified that Collectors who meet one of these criteria are never
listed on the Platform:

  * A Collector who has indicated in the configuration of their Account
    that they do not wish to trade;
  * A Collector who has an average rating of 2.5 / 5 or less;
  * A Collector who has a warning on their profile as described in
    section 8.2.4 of these ToU;
  * A Collector who has not logged into their Account in the last 365 days.

If the number of unique monthly visitors on the Platform is greater than
five million, NUMISTA will publish a charter of good practices that it
undertakes to respect as an online platform operator.


        Section 5.2.2. Financial transparency

In accordance with Section 242 bis of the French General Tax Code,
NUMISTA must, at the time of each transaction carried out by its
intermediary, communicate to the Collectors, fair, clear and transparent
information on the tax and social obligations which fall to them.
Appendix 1 of these Terms of Use specifies these obligations by
referring to the French administration's websites to comply with them.

  * Where applicable, in January of each year, provide each Collector
    with a summary document of transactions and the overall turnover
    achieved by the Collector through the Platform during the previous year.
  * Where applicable, before 31 January of the year following the year
    for which the information is provided, send the French tax
    authorities a summary containing the information provided in the
    summary document sent to each Collector. The Collector is informed
    that NUMISTA will be required to communicate to the tax authorities
    the following information:
      o The number and total gross amount of transactions made by the
        User during the previous calendar year, indicating the amount of
        transactions taxable in France separately;
      o If known by the Operator, the details of the bank account to
        which the User's income is paid.


    SECTION 6. ONLINE REVIEWS

Once an agreement has been reached with a Collector, the other Collector
can leave a review of their exchange experience.

The Collector will be able to indicate a rating between 0 and 5 stars
and post a comment.

The review will be visible on the rated Collector's profile page.

If the rating is less than 5 stars, the rated Collector may post a
response below the rating.

In addition, the Collector may also rate an outing by indicating a
title, a rating and a comment within the dedicated tab of the Platform.

As part of the publication of online reviews carried out on the
Platform, the Operator hereby expressly undertakes to provide Users with
fair, clear and transparent information on the methods of publication
and processing of online reviews. In this respect, NUMISTA undertakes to
display the date of the notice and any updates.

In case of control of the reviews, the Operator undertakes to ensure
that the processing of personal data carried out within this framework
complies with the French Data Protection Act No. 78-17 of 6 January 1978
(“/loi informatique et libertés/”), as amended, and the GDPR.

No compensation is provided by NUMISTA in exchange for the publication
of a Collector's review.

The maximum period of publication of a review is 365 days.

The maximum period of retention of a review on the Platform is 3650 days.

Finally, NUMISTA provides a free feature that allows any User to report
a problem in a review, by sending an email to contact@numista.com
<mailto:contact@numista.com>.

/A posteriori/, and in case of a relevant report, NUMISTA undertakes to
remove a review if it:

  * Does not comply with these Terms of Use;
  * Contains abusive, defamatory, racist or illegal content.

The reviews can be modified at the request of the author of the review.
In this respect, the author shall contact the Operator by private
message on the Platform in order to request the modification.


    SECTION 7. COLLECTOR ACCESS AND ACCOUNT CREATION CONDITIONS

Any User can access the Platform and benefit from the Services described
in section 8.1 of these ToU.

In order to benefit from all the Services offered on the Platform and to
be able to trade with other Collectors, the User must first create an
Account to become a Collector.

Account creation on the Platform as a Collector is free.

To create an Account, the User is invited to click on the "Register"
button and to complete all the required information. The Username and
the password chosen will constitute the Identifiers.

The User wishing to become a Collector must provide the Operator with
accurate, fair and up-to-date data, which does not infringe, in any way
whatsoever, the rights of third parties and communicate to the Operator
any necessary update of the data communicated upon Account creation.

Finally, the User shall validate these ToU before finalising their
account creation.

The Collector will then receive a confirmation email allowing them to
activate their Account.

The Collector agrees to create only one Account on the Platform. The
Operator will not be liable in any way for the harmful consequences that
could result from the use of multiple Accounts for a single Collector.

The User is entirely responsible for the accuracy and updating of the
data communicated in the context of the opening and management of their
Account.


      Section 7.1. Identifiers

The Collector shall be solely liable for the use of their Identifiers or
actions taken through their Account.

In the event that a Collector discloses or uses their Identifiers in a
manner contrary to their intended purpose, the Operator may suspend the
Account.

Under no circumstances shall NUMISTA be held liable in case of theft of
a Collector's identity. Any access and action carried out from a
Collector's Account will be presumed to be carried out by this
Collector, insofar as the Operator is not obliged to and does not have
the technical means to ensure the identity of persons accessing the
Platform from an Account.

Any loss, misappropriation, or unauthorised use of a Collector's
Identifiers and their consequences are the sole responsibility of the
User, who is required to notify NUMISTA, without delay, by email sent to
the following address: contact@numista.com <mailto:contact@numista.com>.


      Section 7.2. Unsubscribing

The Collector may close their Account at any time. The Collector must
connect to their Account, click on "Settings", and then on "Close my
account".

The Account will be immediately deactivated.


    SECTION 8. SERVICES


      Section 8.1. Services offered to all Internet users

Without being registered on the Platform, any internet user can benefit
from the following Services:


        Section 8.1.1. Consulting the Catalogue

From the Platform, the internet user can consult the Catalogue of coins
and banknotes proposed on the Platform by Collectors.

To narrow its search, the internet user can filter the results of the
Catalogue Pages and choose only certain categories (continent, period).

The internet user can also add criteria to its search (e.g., type,
reference, vintage, weight, diameter or length/width, inscription, etc.)
or view Collectibles recently added to the Catalogue.

Users may view Collectibles.


        Section 8.1.2. Viewing Collector Registrations

Users may view Collector Registrations.

More precisely, the Collectibles offered for exchange on the Platform
are visible either on the list of Collectibles of each Collector, this
list being accessible from their profile and from the "Swaps" page, or
on the list of Collectibles offered for exchange for a given type of
coin or banknote, accessible from the Catalogue Page describing this
type of coin or banknote.


        Section 8.1.3. Consulting the forum

By clicking on the "Forum" tab, internet users can consult the messages
published on the Platform's forum but will not be able to reply to them
without having an Account.


        Section 8.1.4. Consulting Numisdoc

From the dedicated tab, the users can consult the articles published in
Numisdoc concerning the following topics:

  * Dates and calendar
  * Numista documentation
  * Numismatic encyclopaedia
  * Country Pages
  * Tools and practical advice.

Internet users can also search for content using the Platform's search
engine.

To be able to write an article, the user must be registered on the Platform.


        Section 8.1.5. Consulting of Outings

By clicking on the "Outings" tab, any Internet user can access the
numismatic outings identified. They can also customise their search
according to the place, dates and type of outing (fair, expo, shop,
market, museum, auction, and Numista outing).

To report an outing, the user must have an Account on the Platform.


      Section 8.2. Services offered to any Collector with an Account on
      the Platform

In addition to the Services available to any internet user, any
Collector registered on the Platform will have access to the following
additional Services:


        Section 8.2.1. Addition of Pages to the Catalogue

The Collector can create Catalogue Pages describing the types of coins
and banknotes for encyclopaedic purposes.

The Catalogue Pages will be checked by an Administrator in order to
verify the accuracy of the data by crossing the information with various
numismatic sources. The Administrator also enforces the recommendations
of modification of the Catalogue.

For more details, the User is invited to consult the following page:
https://en.numista.com/help/guidelines-for-the-numista-
catalogue-141.html <https://en.numista.com/help/guidelines-for-the-
numista-catalogue-141.html>.


        Section 8.2.2. Registration of the collection

Any Collector may enter their collection of Collectibles into the Platform.

The Collector may associate each Registration with a Catalogue Page and
complete it with additional information about the Collectible
(condition, commentary, availability for exchange etc.)

For more details, the Collector can consult the page accessible at the
following address: https://en.numista.com/help/how-can-i-register-my-
collection-on-numista-1.html <https://en.numista.com/help/how-can-i-
register-my-collection-on-numista-1.html>.

The Collector must complete the form to request the addition of a coin
or banknote and create or modify a previous Registration.

The photographs of the Collectibles may come either from the Collector
themselves, who may indicate their name in the credit line under the
photograph, or from NUMISTA's partners who authorise the Collector to
reuse said photographs free of charge on the Platform. In this second
case, the Collector will select the website of origin, which will result
in the display of a link under the photograph.

The Administrators do not validate the Registrations made by the Collectors.

The Collector's coins and/or banknotes must be entered in order to
proceed with Swaps.


        Section 8.2.3. Management of the collection

In accordance with Section 8.2.2. hereof, the Collector may register
their Collectibles on the Platform and specify the type of coin or
banknote, the condition, photographs and comments. There is no limit to
the number of Collectibles that may be added to the Platform by each
Collector.

Thus, the Collector has the possibility to manage their collection by
keeping the inventories accessible online and by storing their comments
and photographs. The photographs are limited to a total of 500 Mb. By
subscribing, the Collector will have more storage space.

The Collector may at any time consult their collection of Collectible
Items using the "My coins", "My banknotes" and "My exonumia" links
accessible on their Account. Only applicable links are displayed. If the
Collector has not saved any coins or banknotes, only the "My coins" link
will be displayed.

The Collector can also view a dashboard with various statistics and data
on their collection and export this information in an Excel document.


        Section 8.2.4. Swaps of Collectibles


          General provisions

Through the Platform, NUMISTA puts Collectors in contact with each other
in order to carry out exchanges.

Collectors are reminded that *presenting oneself as a consumer while
acting in the context of a regular or usual professional activity may be
considered as a misleading commercial practice* punishable by 2-year
imprisonment and a fine of 300 000 euros.
The amount of the fine may be increased in proportion to the benefits
derived from the offence, to 10% of the average annual turnover,
calculated on the last three known annual turnovers at the date of the
facts or to 50% of the expenses incurred for the implementation of an
advertisement or the practice constituting this offence
(/Section L.132-2 of the French Consumer Code/)

Any Collector has the possibility to exchange Collectibles from their
collection registered on the Platform or to enter new Collectibles to be
exchanged.

They can also define the criteria for the Collectibles they wish to get
in an exchange with another Collector.

To find another Collector wishing to exchange their Collectibles, the
Collector may either:

  * Consult the list of Active Collectors, which may be sorted in
    accordance with the provisions of Section 5.2.1. of these ToU; or
  * Consult a Collectible on the Catalogue in order to get acquainted
    with the Collector.

Collectors can then access a dedicated interface on the Platform,
allowing them to select the Collectibles for the Swap and validate the
Swap. At this stage, the Collectors can discuss the terms of the Swap
via a private message service and communicate their addresses to each other.

There can be no financial consideration in the context of the Swap.

The Collectibles are then generally sent by post by the Collectors.


          Moderation of Swaps and fight against fraud

The Operator is only an intermediary in the context of the matchmaking
of the Collectors carrying out a Swap and that does not intervene within
the scope of this Swap of Collectibles.

As part of the fight against fraud, NUMISTA implements the following means:

  * The display of the reviews of each Collector on the page of their
    profile;
  * The display of the number of Swaps considered as being "in progress"
    (i.e., confirmed but not yet reviewed);
  * The possibility for any Collector to report another Collector whose
    behaviour seems suspicious. In this case, the teams of Moderators
    may, if necessary, add a warning message to the profile of the
    Collectors concerned;
  * Mechanisms are implemented by NUMISTA in order to detect a Collector
    having a warning and opening other Accounts on the Platform.
    Automatic warnings may be added.


        Section 8.2.5. Reviews

In accordance with Section 6 hereof, the Collector may publish a review
on the Platform.


        Section 8.2.6. Publications on the Forum

The discussion forum allows Collectors to discuss on the Platform and,
more specifically, to share information or ask questions related to
coins and banknotes and to propose improvements or corrections to the
Platform.

Any Collector will be able to post messages on the forum.

Volunteer moderators enforce the forum's user's charter <https://
en.numista.com/help/forum-policy-77.html>, which invites, in particular,
to be courteous.

Any message that is aggressive, political, commercial or disclosing the
personal information of other Collectors, and more generally not
respecting the provisions of Section 9.1. of these ToU will be deleted.

The Moderators may also deny access to the forum to Collectors who do
not respect the forum's user charter, either temporarily or permanently.


        Section 8.2.7. Publication of Numisdoc

Numisdoc is a collaborative encyclopaedia composed of articles on
various topics related to numismatics, coin and banknote collections and
the use of the Platform.

Any Collector can publish an article within Numisdoc, bearing in mind
that any article is read and, if necessary, corrected by a Moderator
before publication.


        Section 8.2.8. Publication of Outings

The Platform proposes a space dedicated to the census of places and
outings dedicated to coins and banknotes.

Any Collector can suggest an outing on the Platform, bearing in mind
that all content is reviewed and, if necessary, corrected by a Moderator
before publication.

Collectors may indicate the outings in which they plan to participate.

In accordance with Section 6 hereof, any Collector may review an outing.


        Section 8.2.9. Messaging

From the "Messages" tab accessible on their Account, the Collector may
send private messages to other Collectors.


        Section 8.2.10. Updating personal information and profile

From their Account, the Collector can update their personal information
as well as the information on their public profile, accessible on the
Platform.

From this tab, the Collector may choose a privacy option so that their
Collectibles and related information are visible to any internet user,
only to Collectors, or only to the Collector.


      Section 8.3. Services offered as part of the Premium Membership

Optional Services (/no advertising and 10 GB of storage space/) are
offered to Collectors who have taken out a Premium Membership.

To find out the corresponding financial terms, the Collector is invited
to make a request by sending an email to the Operator at the following
address: contact@numista.com <mailto:contact@numista.com>

Subscription to a Premium Membership is governed by the Terms and
Conditions of Subscription.


      Section 8.4. Services offered to Administrators and Moderators

As a referee, every Administrator has an interface on the Platform
dedicated to the administration of coins and banknotes of one or more
countries. From this space, the Administrator can check the Catalogue
Pages and accept or refuse them.

The Administrator will be able to modify the Catalogue Pages relating to
the coins and/or banknotes of the countries for which they are in charge.

The Moderators have access to features that allow them to moderate the
contents of the forum or to ban Collectors. From a dedicated validation
space, the Moderators can also validate the contents of Numisdoc and the
releases.


    SECTION 9. OBLIGATION OF THE PARTIES


      Section 9.1. Obligations of the Users

    of persons and property;
  * Of a commercial nature (prospection, solicitation, prostitution, etc.).


      Section 9.2. Obligations of NUMISTA

The general obligation of the Operator is a best-effort obligation.
NUMISTA has no obligation to achieve a result or reinforced best efforts
of any kind.

The Operator will undertake to use all means to ensure continuity of
access and use of the Platform 7 days a week and 24 hours a day.

However, NUMISTA draws the attention of the Users to the fact that the
current communication protocols via the Internet do not allow to ensure
the transmission of electronic exchanges (messages, documents, identity
of the sender or the recipient) in a certain and continuous way.

In addition, in accordance with the provisions of Sections L.111-7 /et
seq./ of the French Consumer Code, as an online platform operator,
NUMISTA must provide clear, transparent and fair information on the
terms and conditions of its intervention, in particular within Section
5.2. of this Contract.


    SECTION 10. LIABILITY


      Section 10.1. General principles

NUMISTA is not liable in particular in the case of:

  * Impossibility to temporarily access the Platform for technical
    maintenance operations or updating of published information. The
    Users recognise that they cannot seek the liability of the Operator
    in case of dysfunctions or interruptions of the aforementioned
    transmission networks;
  * Virus attacks, illicit intrusion into an automated data processing
    system;
  * Abnormal use or illegal exploitation of the Platform by a User or a
    third party;
  * In relation to the content of third-party websites to which
    hyperlinks on the Platform refer;
  * Non-compliance with these ToU attributable to Users;
  * Delay or non-performance of its obligations, when the reason of the
    delay or non-performance is related to a case of force majeure as
    defined in Section 11 of these ToU;
  * External cause not attributable to the Operator;
  * Unlawful act by a Collector, or contractual breach of contract for
    which a Collector is responsible in the context of the exchange of a
    Collectible;
  * Damages or financial loss from the User resulting from the usage of
    the Content, in particular in the case of erroneous or out-of-date
    valuations or rarity information on Catalogue Pages;
  * Any problem encountered during the performance of the Swap by the
    Collector.

In the event of abnormal use or illicit exploitation of the Platform,
the User is solely liable for any damage caused to third parties and for
the consequences of any claims or actions that may result from this.


      Section 10.2. Hosting provider status

The Users recognise that NUMISTA has the quality of host within the
meaning of the Section 6 I 2° of the French Act No. 2004-575 of 21 June
2004 related to the trust in the digital economy known as “/Loi pour la
confiance dans l’économie numérique/” or “/LCEN/”.

As such, the Operator may remove any content that will have been
reported to him and that it will consider as obviously illegal within
the meaning of Section 6 I 2° of the LCEN.

The notification of the obviously illegal contents by a User or any
other third party must be done by electronic mail to the address
contact@numista.com <mailto:contact@numista.com> or by registered letter
with acknowledgement of receipt to /NUMISTA - 9 boulevard Albert 1er -
06600 ANTIBES, FRANCE/.

In accordance with Section 6 I 5° of the LCEN, the notification, to be
valid, must include the following elements:

  * The date of the notification;
  * If the notifying party is a natural person: surname, first names,
    profession, domicile, nationality, date and place of birth; if the
    applicant is a legal entity: its form, corporate name, registered
    office and the legal representative body;
  * The name and domicile of the recipient or, if it is a legal entity,
    its name and registered office;
  * The description of the litigious facts and their precise location;
  * The reasons for which the content must be withdrawn, including the
    mention of the legal provisions and the justifications of facts;
  * A copy of the correspondence addressed to the author or publisher of
    the litigious information or activities requesting their
    interruption, withdrawal or modification, or the justification that
    the author or publisher could not be contacted.


      Section 10.3. Disputes between Collectors

Any dispute arising between Collectors will be dealt with between them,
the latter remaining solely responsible for the Swap of Collectibles
carried out via the Platform.

For any claim made by a Collector, the other Collector concerned will be
informed within twenty-four (24) business hours by the Operator.

In any event, the Collector must respond to this claim within forty-
eight (48) working hours of notification of the claim.

Concerned about the image of its Platform, the Operator invites the
Collector to do its best to amicably settle any dispute between them and
the other Collector.


      Section 10.4 Social and tax responsibility

All Users warrant that they comply with their social and tax obligations
arising from the use of the Platform and the exchange of Collectibles.

In this respect, all Users are invited to consult Appendix 1 and, if
necessary, with the tax authorities.


    SECTION 11. FORCE MAJEURE

The Operator shall not be liable if the non-performance or delay in
performance of any of its obligations described in these ToU is due to
force majeure.

Force majeure occurs in contractual matters when an event beyond the
control of the debtor, which could not be reasonably foreseen at the
time of the conclusion of the contract and the effects of which cannot
be avoided by appropriate measures, prevents the debtor from fulfilling
its obligation.

If the impediment is temporary, the performance of the obligation is
suspended unless the resulting delay justifies the termination of the
contract. If the impediment is definitive, the contract is automatically
terminated, and the parties are released from their obligations under
the conditions provided for in Sections 1351 and 1351-1 of the French
Civil Code.

In the event of the occurrence of one of the aforementioned events,
NUMISTA will endeavor to inform the User as soon as possible.


    SECTION 12. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY


      Section 12.1. Ownership of Collectors’ intellectual rights

In the course of using the Platform, Collectors may display photographs,
trademarks, logos, designs and other models (Content) belonging to them
or to third parties.

Any Collector reproducing Content through the Platform warrants that
they have the right to display all Content.

In any case, NUMISTA will not be held liable for any act of
counterfeiting, given its simple quality of host of the Content
published by the Collectors.


      Section 12.2. Ownership of NUMISTA’s intellectual property rights

The User acknowledges the intellectual property rights of the Operator
on the Platform, its components and the contents related to it and
waives to contest these rights in any form whatsoever.

The trademarks, logos, slogans, graphics, photographs, animations,
videos, software solutions and texts and any other content on the
Platform, *with the exception of the Content published by the
Collectors*, are the exclusive intellectual property of NUMISTA and may
not be reproduced, used or displayed without express authorisation, or
otherwise face legal proceedings.

Any display or reproduction, total or partial, of the Platform and its
contents, by any process whatsoever, without the prior express
authorisation of NUMISTA, is prohibited and will constitute an
infringement punishable by the provisions of the French Intellectual
Property Code.

In particular, the Operator expressly forbids:

  * The extraction, by permanent or temporary transfer of all or a
    qualitatively or quantitatively substantial part of the content of
    its database on another medium, by any means and in any form whatsoever;
  * Reuse, by making available to the public all or a qualitatively or
    quantitatively substantial part of the contents of the database, in
    any form whatsoever;
  * Reproduction, extraction or reuse, by any means, including methods
    similar to scrapping of content (photographs, descriptions, etc.)
    published by the Operator or by a Collector.

Acceptance of these Terms of Use implies that the Users acknowledge
NUMISTA's intellectual property rights and undertake to comply with them.

The Operator grants a personal, non-exclusive and non-transferable
license to the Users authorising them to use the Platform and the
information it contains in accordance with these ToU.

Any other use of the Platform and its contents is excluded from the
scope of this license and cannot be made without the prior express
authorisation of the Operator.


    SECTION 13. PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION


      Section 13.1. On processing carried out by NUMISTA

NUMISTA is likely to collect personal data as part of the operation of
the Platform

These data are necessary for the management of the Platform, for the
provision of the Services and for the matchmaking of Collectors. These
data will be retained confidentially by NUMISTA for the needs of the
contract, its performance, and in compliance with the law, for a period
of 3 years from the end of the commercial relationship if you are a
customer or from your last contact if you are not yet a customer.

The data may be communicated in whole or in part to NUMISTA's service
providers.

For this reason, the User is invited to consult NUMISTA's Privacy Policy
available at the following address https://en.numista.com/policy.php
<https://en.numista.com/policy.php> which will give them all the
information relating to the protection of personal data and the
processing carried out via the Platform.

In accordance with the /French Data Protection Act No. 78-17 of 6
January 1978, and Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament
and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons
with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement
of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection
Regulation, known as the GDPR)/, the Operator ensures the implementation
of the rights of the data subjects.

The User whose personal data is processed has the right to access,
rectify, update, data portability and deletion of information concerning
them, as well as a right to limit the processing in accordance with
Sections 49, 50, 51, 53 and 55 of the French Data Protection Act and the
provisions of Articles 15, 16, 17 and 18 of the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR).

In accordance with the provisions of Section 56 of the French Data
Protection Act and Article 21 of the GDPR, the User may also, for
legitimate reasons, object to the processing of data concerning them,
without reason and without charge.

The User can also define the fate of their data after death and choose
that NUMISTA communicates or not their data to a third party that the
User will have previously designated.

The User can exercise their rights by sending an email to the address
contact@numista.com <mailto:contact@numista.com> or by sending a letter
to: /NUMISTA - 9 boulevard Albert 1er - 06600 ANTIBES, FRANCE/.

Finally, the User may also lodge a complaint with the supervisory
authorities, in particular the French /Commission Nationale de
l’Informatique et des Libertés/(the “/CNIL/”) (https://www.cnil.fr/fr/
plaintes <https://www.cnil.fr/fr/plaintes>)


      Section 13.2. On processing carried out by Collectors

The Collector may, as the data controller, have to collect and process
the personal data of another Collector in the context of a Swap of
Collectibles carried out from the Platform for the sole purpose of
carrying out the Swap concerned or for delivery. It may also retain
Collectors' data in order to meet their legal obligations or to manage
any disputes with these Collectors. In accordance with the regulations,
the Collector will delete the personal data of other Collectors after
the necessary period.

The Collector warrants that it processes this data in compliance with
the rights and obligations arising from the French Data Protection Act
and the GDPR, bearing in mind that the processing of data in the
domestic context does not fall within the scope of the GDPR.


    SECTION 14. USERS SERVICE

Any questions or complaints regarding the use or operation of the
Platform can be made in the following ways:

  * On the Platform's forum;
  * By email to the address contact@numista.com
    <mailto:contact@numista.com>;
  * By mail to /NUMISTA - 9 boulevard Albert 1er - 06600 ANTIBES, FRANCE/.


    SECTION 15. VALIDITY OF THE TOU

If any provision of these ToU is found to be invalid by any applicable
legislation or regulation and/or by a court decision, it shall be deemed
unwritten and shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions,
which shall remain in full force and effect.

Such a modification or decision does not authorise Users to disregard
these Terms of Use.


    SECTION 16. MODIFICATION OF THE TOU

These Terms of Use apply to any User browsing the Platform.

The ToU may be modified and updated by NUMISTA at any time, in
particular to adapt to legislative or regulatory changes.

The applicable ToU are those in force at the time of the browsing on the
Platform.


    SECTION 17. GENERAL PROVISIONS

The fact that one of the Parties has not demanded the application of any
clause of these ToU, whether permanently or temporarily, shall in no
case be considered as a waiver of said clause.

In case of difficulty of interpretation between any of the titles
appearing at the head of the clauses, and any of these clauses, the
titles will be declared non-existent.

In case of any discrepancy between the English language version and the
French language version of this Agreement, the latter must prevail.


    SECTION 18. JURISDICTION AND GOVERNING LAW

THESE TOU, AS WELL AS THE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE USER AND NUMISTA, ARE
GOVERNED BY FRENCH LAW.

In the event of a dispute between NUMISTA and a User concerning the
interpretation, performance and termination of these ToU, the Parties
will endeavor to settle it amicably.

In such a case, the User is first invited to contact the Operator's
customer service by email at contact@numista.com
<mailto:contact@numista.com> or by mail at the following address: /
NUMISTA - 9 boulevard Albert 1er - 06600 ANTIBES, FRANCE/.

If no agreement is reached, an optional mediation procedure will be
proposed, conducted in a spirit of fairness and good faith with a view
to reaching an amicable agreement in the event of any dispute relating
to this contract, including those concerning its validity.

To initiate this mediation, the consumer User may contact the following
mediator: /Centre de médiation des conciliateurs de justice (CM2C)/, who
may be contacted by post at the address /14 rue Saint Jean – 75017
PARIS, FRANCE/, by email to cm2c@cm2c.net <mailto:cm2c@cm2c.net>, or by
filling in a form on the website accessible at the following address:
https://www.cm2c.net/declarer-un-litige.php <https://www.cm2c.net/
declarer-un-litige.php>.

The Party wishing to initiate the mediation process must first inform
the other Party by a registered letter with acknowledgement of receipt,
indicating the elements of the dispute.

The mediation is not mandatory. The User or NUMISTA can withdraw from
the process at any time.

IN THE EVENT THAT MEDIATION FAILS OR IS NOT CONSIDERED, THE DISPUTE THAT
MAY HAVE GIVEN RISE TO MEDIATION WILL BE REFERRED TO THE COMPETENT COURT.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    APPENDIX 1: Information on civil and tax obligations

Online platform operators have an obligation to inform any user who
carries out commercial transactions on their platform.

Useful information is gathered in educational sheets, recalling the
rules applicable to the declaration of income and the payment of social
contributions.

This information can be found at the following addresses:

  * Concerning tax obligations, link below:
    https://www.impots.gouv.fr/portail/files/
    media/1_metier/1_particulier/EV/1_declarer/141_autres_revenus/eco-

    eco-collabo-fiscal-vente-biens.pdf>
  * On www.urssaf.fr, concerning social obligations, link below:
    https://www.urssaf.fr/portail/home/espaces-dedies/activites-

We remind you that the explanations below are given for information
purposes only and do not replace the reading of French legislative
instruments, administrative comments and case law. We would also like to
insist on the fact that the rules set out above are subject to change
(in particular the different thresholds which are reassessed each year)
and that each User of the Platform is solely responsible for their legal
obligations.

In addition, the tax authorities and social security funds are able to
complete this basic information and answer any questions.

NUMISTA therefore recommends that all Users contact their tax office,
social security office or a specialist adviser in case of doubt.
